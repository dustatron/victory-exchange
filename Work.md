8:15 - 8:30  : Created dumby project
8:30 - 9:30  : Proposal

9:30 - 11:00 : Setup test project with firebase auth 

# First Friday | May
11:00-12:30  : try to work out how to make private routes with react router.

1:00 - 3:00 : watch, read tutorials and documentation. running into issues where user auth is coming later than page load so private routes are acting weird or not working. 

3:30 - 4:00 : got private routes to work. now site waits for auth to load before it renders any content. 

4:00 4:38 : cleaned up project and added navbar with working links.
4:30 - 5:00: update loading screen look while page is waiting for firebase to initialize.

# Second Friday | May 15

8:00 - 8:40 : reorg files
8:40 - 9:20 : update styling for navbar and basic page layout.
9:20 - ? : Design node layout in Draw.io
