#### Victory Exchange

##### Description
Victory exchange is a site that facilitates friends and neighbors to exchange vegetables and other items grown in their home gardens. 

##### Use Case
Home gardening can produce more items of a single crop than an individual might care to eat before the crop goes bad. It could be advisable for that person to trade some of their extra crop with a neighbor who might be in a similar situation but with a different vegetable. 

The users  of this site are primarily individuals who are vegetable gardeners and live among other gardeners. This site will allow users to join ‘Pods’ that represent neighborhoods or other local affiliations. They can post for an item they may be looking for or an item they have and would be willing to trade.  Others on the site can browse through the postings and reply to initiate an exchange.
